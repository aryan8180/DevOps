What is DevOps?
DevOps is a culture, set of practices, and toolchain that unifies software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
Its goal is to increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services faster, with improved quality and reliability.

Key Aspects of DevOps:
	• Automation – of builds, testing, deployment, and infrastructure
	• Continuous Delivery – smaller, faster, and more frequent releases
	• Monitoring – real-time tracking of application and infrastructure performance
	• Collaboration – between Dev and Ops teams using shared tools and responsibilities
	• Feedback Loops – continuous feedback from customers, systems, and teams

DevOps is NOT just about Delivery:
It's about:
	• Faster deployment cycles
	• Better collaboration
	• High system reliability
	• Reduced manual errors
	• Continuous integration, testing, and monitoring

Why DevOps?
Organizations adopt DevOps to:
	1. Accelerate software delivery to meet market demands.
	2. Improve software quality through automation and CI/CD.
	3. Reduce failure rates in production.
	4. Improve recovery time when failures occur.
	5. Break silos between development and operations teams.
	6. Improve customer satisfaction with faster feature releases.
	“If Agile helps you move fast, DevOps helps you move fast with stability.”

Aspect	Agile	DevOps
Focus	Software development	End-to-end software delivery
Teams	Developers only	Dev + Ops + QA + Security
Feedback	From users	From users, systems, operations
Goal	Iterative software development	Continuous delivery and automation
Tools	Jira, Scrum, Kanban	CI/CD tools, Monitoring, IaC

Summary Points:
	• DevOps = Dev + Ops + Automation + Monitoring + Feedback
	• It’s a culture + tools + processes
	• Core principles: Automation, Collaboration, CI/CD, Monitoring
Helps deliver software faster, better, safer
